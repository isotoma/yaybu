Changelog for yaybu
===================

0.1.11 (unreleased)
-------------------

- A Subversion checkout will now understand and happily use data passed to int
  as ProtectedString objects. This means if you use the ``scm_password``
  attribute it won't leak your password into the logs.


0.1.10 (2011-11-10)
-------------------

- Yabyu now depends on Yay 0.0.33 and the improved ``Openers()`` API. This means
  that cookbook assets can be fetched from any location that Yay can be fetched
  from, including http and https.

- This change also means that Yay loading also respects the YAYBUPATH, and that
  http content can be on the YAYBUPATH.

- Fix python-magic fallback - in previous version the fallback was inverted and
  claiming all text was binary


0.1.9 (2011-11-07)
------------------

- Add a basic docs for Vagrant provisioner.
- Add a better fallback for when 'python-magic' isn't installed


0.1.8 (2011-11-04)
------------------

- Allow ``set_interactive`` call on RemoteRunner for batch processing use cases
- Allow API users to set a particular identity file with set_identity_file
