Introduction

Yaybu fills the same need as Puppet_ or Chef_: it provides an automation layer
on top of your systems management processes, increasing reliability, removing
repetitive manual tasks and providing a configuration database.

Why use Yaybu?
==============

There are a number of reasons we've written Yaybu, rather than using Puppet or Chef:

 **It's written in Python**
  Puppet and Chef are both written in Ruby. If you already have a significant investment in Python, as we do, retraining a large number of people in Ruby isn't such a great option.
 **It has a better configuration language: YAY**
  The language used to write your configurations is where your system administrators will be spending a lot of their time. This language needs to be appropriate for their needs, with enough power that they don't have to cut and paste a lot of text. Yay is that language.
